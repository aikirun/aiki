# Idempotency

Idempotency keys provide an additional layer of protection against duplicate workflow and task executions. They allow
you to safely retry operations without creating duplicates, even when the same request is sent multiple times.

## What are Idempotency Keys?

An idempotency key is a unique identifier that:

- Is provided by the client when starting a workflow or task
- Is stored with the workflow/task execution
- Prevents duplicate executions when the same key is used
- Allows safe retries of failed operations

## Workflow Idempotency

When starting workflows, you can provide an idempotency key to prevent duplicate workflow runs:

```typescript
// Start a workflow with idempotency key
const resultHandle = await orderWorkflowV1.start(client, {
  payload: { orderId: "order-123", items: [...] },
  idempotencyKey: "order-123-process" // Unique key for this order
});

// If this exact same call is made again with the same idempotency key,
// it will return the same workflow run instead of creating a duplicate
const duplicateHandle = await orderWorkflowV1.start(client, {
  payload: { orderId: "order-123", items: [...] },
  idempotencyKey: "order-123-process" // Same key
});

// duplicateHandle.id === resultHandle.id (same workflow run)
```

## Task Idempotency

Tasks within a workflow are **automatically idempotent** by default. When you run the same task with the same payload
multiple times, it will only execute once and return the cached result:

```typescript
const sendEmail = task({
	name: "send-welcome-email",
	run({ payload }) {
		return sendEmailToUser(payload.email, welcomeTemplate);
	},
});

// First call: Actually executes the task
await sendEmail.start(workflowRun, {
	payload: { email: "user@example.com" },
});

// Second call with same payload: Returns cached result, doesn't execute again
await sendEmail.start(workflowRun, {
	payload: { email: "user@example.com" },
});
```

## How Idempotency Works

### Workflow Level

When you provide an `idempotencyKey` when starting a workflow, the system checks if a workflow run with that key
already exists. If it does, it returns the existing workflow run instead of creating a new one.

### Task Level

Tasks within a workflow are automatically idempotent based on their payload. The system generates a unique path for each
task execution that includes:

- The workflow path
- The task name
- A hash of the task payload

When you provide an `idempotencyKey`, it's added to this path, allowing you to create different execution contexts for
the same task and payload combination.

## Determinism vs Idempotency Keys

You might wonder: if tasks are deterministic (same input â†’ same output) and automatically idempotent within workflows,
why do we need idempotency keys? This is a great question that highlights the complementary nature of these concepts.

### The Apparent Tension

There seems to be a logical conflict:

- **Determinism**: Same input always produces same output
- **Automatic Idempotency**: Same payload within a workflow only executes once
- **Idempotency keys**: Allow forcing re-execution of the same task with same payload

If tasks are truly deterministic and automatically idempotent, why would we ever want to execute the same task twice
with the same input?

### Why Idempotency Keys Are Valuable

#### 1. Intentional Re-execution

Sometimes you want the same task executed multiple times for different reasons:

```typescript
const sendEmail = task({
	name: "send-email",
	run({ payload }) {
		return sendEmailToUser(payload.email, payload.content);
	},
});

// First call: Send welcome email
await sendEmail.start(workflowRun, {
	payload: { email: "user@example.com", content: "Welcome!" },
});

// Second call: Send reminder email (same email, different intent)
await sendEmail.start(workflowRun, {
	payload: { email: "user@example.com", content: "Welcome!" },
	idempotencyKey: "reminder-email-user-123", // Forces re-execution
});
```

### Design Philosophy

This design follows the principle of **flexible execution control**:

- **Determinism**: Ensures task logic is predictable, testable, and reliable
- **Automatic Idempotency**: Prevents accidental duplicate executions by default
- **Idempotency keys**: Provide explicit control when you need the same operation to happen multiple times

It's similar to having a cache with the ability to bypass it when needed - the function is pure and deterministic, but
you can control when to use cached results vs. fresh execution.

## Benefits of Idempotency Keys

1. **Force Re-execution**: Allow the same task with same payload to execute multiple times when needed
2. **Different Contexts**: Enable the same operation to happen in different execution contexts
3. **Intentional Duplicates**: Support scenarios where you want the same operation to occur multiple times
4. **Flexible Control**: Provide explicit control over when to bypass automatic idempotency

## When to Use Idempotency Keys

- **Multiple Executions**: When you need the same operation to happen multiple times (emails, notifications)
- **Different Contexts**: Processing the same data for different purposes (audit, compliance, retry)
- **Intentional Retries**: When you want to retry an operation with the same input but track it separately
- **Bypass Cache**: When you need fresh execution even with the same payload

## Summary

Determinism, automatic idempotency, and idempotency keys work together to provide flexible execution control:

- **Determinism** ensures your task logic is reliable and predictable
- **Automatic Idempotency** prevents accidental duplicate executions by default
- **Idempotency keys** give you explicit control when you need the same operation to happen multiple times

Together, they provide the foundation for building robust, efficient, and maintainable workflows that can handle both
the need for consistency and the flexibility for intentional re-execution.
