  - Critical for production reliability
- [ ] **Error Serialization**: Proper error capture with stack traces and context
  - Currently TODO in `sdk/task/task.ts` (search for error serialization) - errors cast to string without context

### Workflow Results
- [ ] **Workflow Result Persistence**: Store and retrieve workflow execution results
  - Currently TODO in `sdk/workflow/version/workflow-version.ts` (search for result persistence)
  - Need server API endpoint and database schema for output storage
