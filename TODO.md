# Aiki TODO

This document tracks planned features and improvements for the Aiki durable workflow engine.

## Priority 0: Production Blockers üö®

These items block production adoption and must be implemented first.

### Task Reliability
- [ ] **Task Retry Logic**: Implement automatic retry with exponential backoff for failed tasks
  - Currently TODO in `sdk/task/task.ts:66` - tasks fail permanently without retries
  - Need to track retry attempts, implement backoff delays, persist retry state
  - Critical for production reliability
- [ ] **Error Serialization**: Proper error capture with stack traces and context
  - Currently TODO in `sdk/task/task.ts:78` - errors cast to string without context
  - Need to serialize Error objects with message, stack, cause, name

### Workflow Results
- [ ] **Workflow Result Persistence**: Store and retrieve workflow execution results
  - Currently TODO in `sdk/workflow/version/workflow-version.ts:81`
  - Need server API endpoint and database schema for output storage
  - Required for `WorkflowRunResultHandle` to actually return results

### Type Safety
- [ ] **Task Result Type Validation**: Runtime validation of pre-existing task results
  - Currently TODO in `sdk/workflow/run/run-handle.ts:48`

## Priority 3: Package Architecture üì¶

Modularization for better tree-shaking and deployment flexibility.

### Independent Packages
- [ ] **Split into separate packages**: Enable independent installation
  - `@aiki/workflow` - Workflow definition APIs
  - `@aiki/task` - Task definition and execution
  - `@aiki/worker` - Worker infrastructure
  - `@aiki/client` - Client SDK for starting workflows
  - Benefits: Tree-shaking, smaller bundles, clearer dependencies

### Streaming & Real-time
- [ ] **Result Streaming**: Stream workflow results and events down to SDK (Redis Streams based)
  - Real-time progress updates
  - Event notifications
  - Use Redis Streams XREAD for consumption

---

## Priority 4: Advanced Features üöÄ

Nice-to-have features for advanced use cases.

### Execution Control
- [ ] **Block Until Complete**: Add method to wait for workflow completion
  - Synchronous workflow execution option
- [ ] **Workflow Pausing**: Support for pausing workflows mid-execution
  - Manual pause/resume
- [ ] **Webhook Integration**: Pause workflow execution until external webhook is called
  - Callback URLs for external systems

### Task Management
- [ ] **Task Cancellation**: Implement graceful task cancellation with status checking
  - Workers check cancellation status before updating storage
